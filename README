dirlisting-rss generates an RSS feed of your directory listing. It is written in PHP.

USE CASE:

I wanted to share photo galleries as static HTML.
There's one gallery per directory.
Friends and family should be able to be notified whenever I upload a new gallery.

HOWTO USE:

* Change domain names and filenames as necessary
* Upload feed.php and .htaccess to your website
* Start creating directories on the server
* Go to http://www.yourdomain.com/feed to get the RSS feed
